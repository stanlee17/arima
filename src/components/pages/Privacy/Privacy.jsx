            <p>
              Personal Information is information or an opinion that identifies
              an individual. Examples of Personal Information we collect
              includes names, addresses, email addresses, phone and facsimile
              numbers. This Personal Information is obtained in many ways
              including name, email, our website and from third parties.
            </p>
            <p>
              We donâ€™t guarantee website links or policy of authorised third
              parties. We collect your Personal Information for the primary
              purpose of providing our services to you, providing information to
              our clients and marketing. We may also use your Personal
              Information for secondary purposes closely related to the primary
              purpose, in circumstances where you would reasonably expect such
              use or disclosure.
            </p>
            <p>
              You may unsubscribe from our mailing/marketing lists at any time
              by contacting us in writing. When we collect Personal Information
              we will, where appropriate and where possible, explain to you why
              we are collecting the information and how we plan to use it.

            <h3>Security of Personal Information</h3>
            <p>
              Your Personal Information is stored in a manner that reasonably
              protects it from misuse and loss and from unauthorized access,

              take reasonable steps to destroy or permanently de-identify your
              Personal Information. However, most of the Personal Information is
              or will be stored in client files which will be kept by us for a
              minimum of 7 years.
